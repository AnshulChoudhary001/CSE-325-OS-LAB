**Learning Outcomes: File Manipulation using System Calls**

### 1. Understanding System Calls for File Manipulation

**Outcome:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental system calls used in file manipulation, such as `open`, `read`, `write`, `close`, and `lseek`.

### 2. Application of System Calls for Copying File Content

**Outcome:** Acquire practical skills in using system calls to copy the content of files. This includes copying the first and second halves of a file into newly created files, enhancing proficiency in file handling.

### 3. Reading from Console and Writing to a File

**Outcome:** Learn to read user input from the console until a specific character (e.g., '$') is entered and then write the input to a file. Develop a hands-on understanding of utilizing system calls for interactive input/output operations.

### 4. Reading File Contents without Using Char Array

**Outcome:** Gain insight into reading file contents character by character without relying on char arrays or built-in functions like `sizeof()` and `strlen()`. Understand the importance of direct manipulation of file content.

### 5. Pointer Repositioning in Files using lseek

**Outcome:** Understand the significance of the `lseek` system call for repositioning the file pointer. Explore its application in scenarios such as file appending, where the pointer needs to be positioned at the end of the file.

### 6. File Size Retrieval using lseek

**Outcome:** Learn how to determine the size of a file using the `lseek` system call, specifically by positioning the pointer at the end of the file and retrieving the offset as the file size. Understand the practical application of this technique.

### 7. Practical Implementation of File Manipulation Commands

**Outcome:** Gain hands-on experience in implementing file manipulation commands similar to those used in Linux shell commands (e.g., `cp`). Develop practical skills that are directly applicable in system programming and related fields.

### 8. Practical Application of Linux Shell Commands

**Outcome:** Understand the working behind commonly used Linux shell commands, specifically the `cp` command. Gain insights into how these commands leverage low-level system calls for effective file manipulation.

### 9. Enhanced Programming Proficiency

**Outcome:** Improve programming proficiency through the application of system calls. Develop the ability to create programs that interact with files efficiently, handle user input, and perform operations such as copying, reading, and writing.

### 10. Real-world Relevance

**Outcome:** Recognize the real-world relevance of system calls in file manipulation. Understand how these concepts are employed in the implementation of essential commands and operations encountered in system programming and software development.
