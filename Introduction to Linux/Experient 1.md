# Experient 1 - Introduction to Linux Commands

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to acquaint students with various shells of different operating systems and the fundamental commands necessary to perform diverse functions and operations within a Linux/Windows environment.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this experiment, students will be proficient in using the Linux/Windows shell and command prompt, enabling them to execute a variety of commands effectively.

## Theory

### 1. Listing Files and Directories
- **Linux:** `ls`
- **Windows:** `Dir`

### 2. Long and Time Formatted Listing
- **Linux:** `ls -alt`
- **Windows:** `Dir`

### 3. Changing Directories
- **Linux/Windows:** `cd abc`

### 4. Changing to Home Directory
- **Linux:** `cd ~` or `cd`
- **Windows:** `cd` or `chdir`

### 5. Showing Current Working Directory
- **Linux/Windows:** `pwd` or `cd/chdir`

### 6. Creating a Directory
- **Linux/Windows:** `mkdir abc` or `md abc`

### 7. Creating a File
- **Linux:** `touch file.txt`
- **Windows:** `notepad file.txt`

### 8. Updating Timestamp of a File
- **Linux:** `touch filename`
- **Windows:** *Not applicable*

### 9. Deleting Files
- **Linux:** `rm filename`
- **Windows:** `Del filename`

### 10. Concatenating and Printing Files
- **Linux:** `cat file1 file2`
- **Windows:** *Not applicable*

### 11. Copying Files
- **Linux:** `cp source destination`
- **Windows:** `Copy source destination`

### 12. Moving Files
- **Linux:** `mv source destination`
- **Windows:** `Move source destination`

## Explanation in Depth

1. **Listing Files and Directories (`ls`/`Dir`):** This command is used to display a list of files and directories in the current directory.

2. **Long and Time Formatted Listing (`ls -alt`/`Dir`):** This command provides a detailed list of files and directories, including information like permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps.

3. **Changing Directories (`cd abc`):** It allows the user to change the current working directory to the specified directory.

4. **Changing to Home Directory (`cd ~`/`cd`/`cd` or `chdir`):** This command changes the current directory to the user's home directory.

5. **Showing Current Working Directory (`pwd`/`cd/chdir`):** It prints the current working directory, indicating the user's current position in the file system.

6. **Creating a Directory (`mkdir abc`/`md abc`):** This command is used to create a new directory with the specified name.

7. **Creating a File (`touch file.txt`/`notepad file.txt`):** In Linux, the `touch` command creates an empty file with the specified name. In Windows, `notepad` opens a text editor to create or edit the file.

8. **Updating Timestamp of a File (`touch filename`):** The `touch` command updates the access and modification timestamps of a file, and if the file does not exist, it creates an empty file.

9. **Deleting Files (`rm filename`/`Del filename`):** This command deletes the specified file. In Linux, it's `rm`, and in Windows, it's `Del`.

10. **Concatenating and Printing Files (`cat file1 file2`):** In Linux, the `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files. In Windows, there isn't a direct equivalent.

11. **Copying Files (`cp source destination`/`Copy source destination`):** This command is used to copy files from one location to another.

12. **Moving Files (`mv source destination`/`Move source destination`):** It moves files from one location to another, and in the process, the file is effectively renamed if the destination has a different name.

By understanding and practicing these commands, students gain essential skills for navigating and manipulating files and directories within a Linux/Windows environment.
